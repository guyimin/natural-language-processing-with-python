# Jupyter notebooks for the book "Natural Language Processing with Python"

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book [Natrual Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/). Note that the original text of the book features far more content than you will find in these notebooks, in particular further explanations and figures. Here we have only included the code samples themselves and immediately related surrounding comments.
